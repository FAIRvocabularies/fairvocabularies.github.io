# About the FAIR vocabularies project

This website and the work related to FAIR vocabularies presented here has been produced by a working group, which started in the [Dagstuhl workshop](https://codata.org/initiatives/strategic-programme/decadal-programme/dagstuhl-workshop-2019/) on "Interoperability of Metadata Standards in Cross-Domain Science, Health and Social Science Applications" organised by CODATA and DDI.

## [Ten Simple Rules for making a vocabulary FAIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02325)
Simon J D Cox, Alejandra N Gonzalez-Beltran, Barbara Magagna, Maria-Cristina Marinescu

### Abstract
We present ten simple rules that support converting a legacy vocabulary -- a list of terms available in a print-based glossary or table not accessible using web standards -- into a FAIR vocabulary. Various pathways may be followed to publish the FAIR vocabulary, but we emphasise particularly the goal of providing a distinct IRI for each term or concept. A standard representation of the concept should be returned when the individual IRI is de-referenced, using SKOS or OWL serialised in an RDF-based representation for machine-interchange, or in a web-page for human consumption. Guidelines for vocabulary and item metadata are provided, as well as development and maintenance considerations. By following these rules you can achieve the outcome of converting a legacy vocabulary into a standalone FAIR vocabulary, which can be used for unambiguous data annotation. In turn, this increases data interoperability and enables data integration.
