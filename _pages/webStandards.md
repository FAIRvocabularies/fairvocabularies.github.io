# Web Standards

The implementation of FAIR vocabularies relies on the use of web standards.

If you are not familiar with web standards, and the web architecture, here we provide some definitions and pointers to material that will provide an introduction to these topics.

The World Wide Web Consortium provides a lot of information on the foundational technologies and principles that sustain the web in their [web architecture](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/).

## Identifiers

Here we refer to [web identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#identification), which rely on a global identification system based on Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). Below we provide some reference to web identifiers such as **URLs**, **URIs** and **IRIs**.

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.

A URI is a name designed to be unique, there are many schemes. A URI is a name that can be encoded using standard Latin alphabet, numbers and a limited set of other characters (the ASCII character set), following rules specified in [IETF RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)

An IRI is a generalised URI that allows names constructed with non-Latin characters and a broader set of symbols (anything that can be encoded using UTF-8)
