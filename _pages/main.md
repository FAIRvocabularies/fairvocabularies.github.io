Cross-discipline data discovery, integration, and synthesis remain challenging tasks for technical, social and content-related reasons. However, those tasks are crucial for addressing global scientific and societal challenges. Understanding the data, identifying the terminology used to annotate them, and how they relate is a prerequisite to enable data integration. 

Here we provide a series of guidelines that help on creating and using FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable & Reusable) vocabularies.
