Cross-discipline data discovery, integration, and synthesis remain challenging tasks for technical, social and content-related reasons. However, those tasks are crucial for addressing global scientific and societal challenges. Understanding the data, identifying the terminology used to annotate them, and how they relate is a prerequisite to enable data integration. 

Here we provide a series of guidelines that help on creating and using **FAIR**   (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable & Reusable) vocabularies.

# What is a FAIR vocabulary?

The [FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardshipt](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) provide recommendations to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

One of the principles indicate that to be interoperable:

> I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles

In this project we provide guidance for FAIR vocabularies, which are crucial to producing FAIR data. 

For a vocabulary to be FAIR, it should be:
- **Findable**: be registered (indexed, listed) in a vocabulary service
- **Accessible**: be available on the web, downloadable
- **Interoperable**: encoded in a standard representation, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) or SKOS and domain-specific extensions
- **Reusable**: licensed and maintained, ideally with an open license 

FAIR vocabularies representation relies on [web standards](_pages/webStandards.md)
