# Guidelines for FAIR Vocabularies

Cross-discipline data discovery, integration, and synthesis remain challenging tasks for technical, social and content-related reasons. However, those tasks are crucial for addressing global scientific and societal challenges. Understanding the data, identifying the terminology used to annotate them, and how they relate is a prerequisite to enable data integration. Here we provide a series of guidelines that help on creating and using FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable & Reusable) vocabularies.

## Rules for making a vocabulary FAIR

1. Verify that the source license allows repurposing
1. Determine the governance arrangements and custodian responsible for the legacy vocabulary
1. Check minimal term definition completeness 
1. Select a domain and service for the web identifiers 
1. Design an identifier scheme and pattern 
1. Create a semantic-standards based vocabulary - Interoperability
1. Add rich metadata - Reusability
1. Register the vocabulary - Findability 
1. Make the IRIs resolve - Accessibility 
1. Develop and implement a process for maintaining the FAIR vocabulary
